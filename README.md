# How to close/open the app during a session in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-openApp) using the Appium & Python Language

While performing automation testing with Appium on LambdaTest Grid, you might face a scenario where you'd want to close the application or open the application during a test run. 
This can be essential sometimes to see how your application behaves in different scenarios. Let's see how we can leverage Appium's commands to achieve it on LambdaTest.

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.
- Alternatively you can also use the `Custom ID` that you defined in your own words.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Python test on LambdaTest.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You can update your custom capabilities in test scripts. In this sample project, we are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```
from appium import webdriver
from appium.webdriver.common.mobileby import MobileBy
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
import time
import os

desired_caps = {
    "deviceName":"Galaxy S20",
    "platformName":"Android",
    "platformVersion":"10",
    "app":"lt://", 
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "build":"Python Vanilla Android",
    "name":"Sample Test - Python",
    "network":True,
    "visual":True,
    "video":True
}

def startingTest():
    if os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME") is None:
        username = "username"  #Enter LT username here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        username = os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME")
    if os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY") is None:
        accesskey = "accesskey" #Enter LT accesskey here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        accesskey = os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY")
    
    try:
        driver = webdriver.Remote(desired_capabilities=desired_caps, command_executor="https://"+username+":"+accesskey+"@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub")
        colorElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color")))
        colorElement.click()

        textElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text")))
        textElement.click()

        toastElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast")))
        toastElement.click()

        #Close the application being tested
        driver.close_app()

        #Open the application being tested
        driver.open_app()

        notification = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification")))
        notification.click()
        
        driver.quit()
    except:
        driver.quit()

startingTest()
```

* [Close App | Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/commands/device/app/close-app/)

## Executing The Tests

Run the following command in the directory where your project has been saved to execute your build.

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```bash
python3 ios.py
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

```bash
python3 android.py
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
